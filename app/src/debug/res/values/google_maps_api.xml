    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=A1:58:18:C6:23:11:F4:AA:57:87:93:89:DD:A0:B9:7B:F8:5A:C0:A3%3Bca.ualberta.cs.unter

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    A1:58:18:C6:23:11:F4:AA:57:87:93:89:DD:A0:B9:7B:F8:5A:C0:A3;ca.ualberta.cs.unter

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
